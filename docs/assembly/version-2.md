# Soldering Instructions - V2

Version from 2023

## How to Proceed

- **Always solder only one level at a time.**
- Take one component from the holder, solder it, and only after that take another one. (They are easy to mixup.)
- Once you have soldered everything, glue a padding underneath the USB connector.

!!! info "Important Information"
    - Start by soldering the integrated circuit. As last solder the LED.
        - Be mindful of the orientation of the integrated circuit. If you're unsure, ask the instructor.
	- Polarity usually matters with LEDs. However, on this board, you don't have to worry about polarity; the circuit is designed to be polarity-agnostic.

!!! danger "Work Safety"
	- The tip of the soldering iron is hot (~300 Â°C).
	- Always place the soldering iron back in its stand.
	- Keep your workspace tidy.
	- If you get burned, go and cool the burned area with water (do not use ice). Don't rub anything on the burned area.
