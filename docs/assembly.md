# Soldering Instructions

## How to Proceed

- **Always solder only one level at a time.**
- Always take one component, solder it, and then proceed with the next.
- Start by soldering the integrated circuit.
  - Be mindful of the orientation of the integrated circuit. If you're unsure, ask the instructor.
- Then you can solder the other components.
- Once you have soldered, attach a pad underneath the USB connector.

!!! danger "Work Safety"
	- The tip of the soldering iron is hot (~300 Â°C).
